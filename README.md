**Constellation** is a modern Configuration Management Database (CMDB) that uses graph technology to track and visualize all your organization's assets - from infrastructure and applications to people, processes, and policies.

⚠️ Note: Constellation is currently under development and not production-ready.

## Quick Start

**New to Constellation? Get everything running in 3 steps:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loreleimoutiez/Constellation.git
cd Constellation

# 2. First time setup
make setup

# 3. Start development environment  
make start-bg
```

**That's it!** Everything is now running:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs  
- **Neo4j Browser:** http://localhost:7474 (neo4j/constellation123)

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- **Node.js 18+** for frontend development
- 4GB+ RAM available
- Ports 5173, 7474, 7687, 8000 available

## Use Cases

- **"What breaks if this server fails?"** → Impact Analysis
- **"Who has access to this system?"** → Dependency tracking  
- **"Which services have no backup maintainer?"** → Bus factor analysis
- **"What policies cover this data?"** → Compliance mapping
- **"What's the blast radius of this change?"** → Change impact assessment

## Key Features

### Current Features
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for powerful relationship modeling
- **Modern Frontend**: Vue.js 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS responsive interface
- **RESTful API**: Complete CRUD operations with FastAPI
- **Asset Management**: Track hardware, software, people, processes, policies
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand dependencies and blast radius of changes
- **Search & Filtering**: Text search and advanced filtering capabilities
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks and monitoring

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start your development session
make start-bg      # Everything runs in background

# Check status anytime
make check         # See what's running

# View logs when needed
make logs          # Backend logs
make logs-api      # API logs only

# End your session
make stop          # Stop everything cleanly
```

## API Endpoints

The API provides comprehensive Configuration Item management:

### Core Operations
- `GET /api/v1/cis` - List all CIs with filtering
- `POST /api/v1/cis` - Create new CI
- `GET /api/v1/cis/{id}` - Get specific CI details
- `PUT /api/v1/cis/{id}` - Update CI
- `DELETE /api/v1/cis/{id}` - Delete CI

### Impact Analysis
- `GET /api/v1/impact/{id}` - Analyze impact of CI failure
- `GET /api/v1/dependencies/{id}` - Get CI dependencies
- `GET /api/v1/busfactor` - Identify critical single points of failure

### System
- `GET /health` - Health check with database status
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation

**Full API documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs (when running)

## Data Model

Constellation models your infrastructure as interconnected nodes:

- **Configuration Items**: Hardware, Software, Services, Applications
- **Human Assets**: People, Teams, Roles, Skills  
- **Governance**: Processes, Policies, Controls, Risks
- **External**: Vendors, Partners, Contracts
- **Digital Assets**: Datasets, Identities, Credentials

## Testing

```bash
make test           # Run API tests
make test-frontend  # Run frontend tests
```

### Test Architecture

Constellation uses a comprehensive test suite with modern testing patterns:

**Factory Pattern**: Test data is created using factory functions that provide sensible defaults and make tests more maintainable. Located in `backend/tests/factories.py`.

**Coverage**: 92 comprehensive test cases covering all data models with 100% model coverage.

**Test Structure**:
- Model validation and creation tests
- Business logic and constraint tests  
- JSON serialization and API compatibility tests
- Relationship and dependency tests

All tests run automatically via `make test` and use the same Docker environment as development.

## Configuration

Key environment variables (configured automatically by `make setup`):

```bash
# Database
NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=constellation123

# API
PROJECT_NAME=Constellation
API_V1_STR=/api/v1

# Development
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Data isolation
Each installation of Constellation runs fully locally inside Docker containers.
All assets, relationships, and changes are stored in **local Docker volumes and do not affect other installations**.

## Security Note
Default credentials (neo4j/constellation123) are provided **for development and testing only**.
For production or shared deployments, you must change these values in your .env file and configure secure credentials.
